# BoomBikes Sharing - Multiple Linear Regression Assignment with RFE and MinMax Scaling

# Introduction:

Welcome to the BoomBikes sharing project! In this assignment, our objective is to develop a robust multiple linear regression model that accurately predicts the demand for shared bikes. This model will provide valuable insights to BoomBikes, helping them navigate the American market post-lockdown by identifying and understanding the key factors that influence bike demand.
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has recently experienced a significant decline in revenues. To address this issue, they have enlisted the help of a consulting firm to analyze and identify the key factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. BoomBikes is particularly interested in understanding:
Which variables are critical in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
The extent to which these variables explain the fluctuations in bike demand.
By gaining insights into these factors, BoomBikes aims to better anticipate customer needs and enhance their service offerings to improve revenue and market position.

# Problem Statement:


BoomBikes, a bike-sharing company based in the United States, has recently seen a sharp drop in its revenue. In an effort to reverse this trend, the company has engaged a consulting firm to analyze and uncover the main factors that influence the demand for shared bikes in the American market. BoomBikes is specifically interested in understanding:

1. Which factors are most crucial for predicting the demand for their bike-sharing services.
2. The degree to which these factors account for variations in bike demand.**

By gaining a clearer understanding of these dynamics, BoomBikes hopes to better forecast customer preferences and improve their service offerings, ultimately boosting revenue and strengthening their market presence.

# Business goal:

The project aims to model bike demand using available independent variables. This will enable BoomBikes to:

1. Predict bike demand based on different features.
2. Optimize business strategies to meet customer expectations and market demands.
3. Gain insights into demand dynamics for potential market expansion.

# Data description:

The dataset provided encompasses daily bike demand data along with several independent variables that are believed to impact this demand. Here is an overview of the key features included in the dataset:

1. Feature 1: Description of feature 1.
2. Feature 2: Description of feature 2.
3. ...
4. Feature n: Description of feature n.

These features collectively contribute to understanding the dynamics of bike demand, enabling us to build a predictive model that BoomBikes can leverage to optimize their business strategies post-lockdown.

# Approach:

## Data Preprocessing:

1. Handle missing values: Check for any missing data in the dataset and apply appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal based on the context and impact on the analysis.

2. Encode categorical variables if necessary: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding to facilitate their inclusion in the regression model.

3. Scale numerical variables using MinMax scaling: Normalize numerical variables to a common scale (usually between 0 and 1) to prevent any single variable from dominating the model due to its larger scale.

## Feature Selection:

1. Use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select significant features for the model: RFE iteratively removes less significant features from the model and evaluates its performance until the optimal set of features is identified.

## Model Building:

1. Build a multiple linear regression model using selected features: Construct a linear regression model using the features identified through RFE to predict bike demand based on their respective coefficients.

2. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics: Assess the model's accuracy and reliability using metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and root mean squared error (RMSE) to gauge how well it predicts actual bike demand.

## Model Interpretation:

1. Interpret the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each feature on bike demand: Analyze the sign and magnitude of coefficients to determine which features have the strongest influence on bike demand, whether positively or negatively.

By following this structured approach, we aim to develop a robust multiple linear regression model that provides actionable insights into the factors driving bike demand for BoomBikes post-lockdown.


# Implementation:

The project will be conducted using a Jupyter notebook and Python. The following is a high-level outline of the notebook structure:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - **Load Dataset:** Import the dataset containing daily bike demand data along with the relevant independent variables.
   - **Initial Exploration:** Examine the dataset to understand its structure, dimensions, and initial characteristics.
   - **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute summary statistics to describe central tendencies and distributions of the data.
   - **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate key features and relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Handle Missing Values:** Address any missing data by imputing values or removing affected rows/columns as appropriate.
   - **Encode Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding, if needed.
   - **Scale Numerical Variables:** Normalize numerical features using MinMax scaling to ensure they fall within a consistent range (typically between 0 and 1).

3. **Feature Selection with RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination):**
   - **Implement RFE:** Apply RFE with a linear regression model to identify the most significant features for predicting bike demand.
   - **Feature Selection:** Iteratively remove less influential features until the optimal subset of features is determined.

4. **Model Building and Evaluation:**
   - **Build Model:** Develop a multiple linear regression model using the features selected by RFE.
   - **Train-Test Split:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.
   - **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model using metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
   - **Prediction Analysis:** Visualize the actual versus predicted values to evaluate the model's accuracy and identify any patterns or discrepancies.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**
   - **Interpret Coefficients:** Analyze the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on bike demand.
   - **Summarize Findings:** Provide a summary of the key insights and trends identified through the analysis.
   - **Actionable Recommendations:** Offer recommendations based on the model's results to guide BoomBikes' strategic decisions.
   - **Discuss Limitations:** Outline any limitations of the analysis and suggest areas for further research or improvement.

By following this structured approach, the Jupyter notebook will facilitate a clear and reproducible analysis of bike demand prediction using multiple linear regression.

# Conclusion:


Upon completing this project, our goal is to provide BoomBikes with actionable insights into the factors affecting bike demand in the American market following the lockdown. These insights will lay the groundwork for crafting strategic initiatives designed to bolster BoomBikes' market position and boost profitability.
Through rigorous data analysis and advanced modeling techniques, we have investigated how various independent variables influence bike demand. By employing sophisticated statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, we have pinpointed critical predictors that impact daily bike rental numbers.
Our findings reveal significant trends and patterns that will enable BoomBikes to make data-driven decisions in areas such as inventory management, marketing strategies, and operational planning. Understanding customer preferences and environmental factors affecting bike usage allows BoomBikes to optimize resource allocation and improve customer satisfaction.
In summary, this project not only deepens our understanding of bike-sharing dynamics but also equips BoomBikes to adapt effectively to market shifts and seize new opportunities in the post-lockdown landscape.
